# IRIS

There are 150 observations with four features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).
There are no null values, so we don't have to worry about that.
There are 50 observations of each species (stoas, versicolor, and virginica)
I ran the whole Jupiter notebook and got a requirements.txt file that contained all the requirements and an app.py file that I had just uploaded to GitHub. I then connected GitHub to streamlit to make an app, which is public, and below is the link for that app.
